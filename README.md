# Build_Basic_Neural_Network
This repository contains a basic implementation of a neural network for binary classification. The network is designed to solve the XOR problem and demonstrates the fundamental concepts of forward and backpropagation using the sigmoid activation function

## Project Structure

The project is implemented in a single Python script (or a Jupyter Notebook if you are using Colab) and consists of the following steps:

1.  **Import Required Libraries**: Imports necessary libraries, primarily NumPy for numerical operations.
2.  **Define Activation Function**: Implements the sigmoid activation function and its derivative.
3.  **Initialize the Neural Network Structure**: Sets up the network with a defined number of input, hidden, and output neurons, and initializes weights and biases randomly.
4.  **Forward Propagation**: Calculates the output of the network for a given input.
5.  **Backpropagation**: Adjusts the weights and biases based on the calculated error to minimize the loss.
6.  **Training the Network**: Runs the forward and backpropagation steps over multiple epochs using a simple XOR dataset.
7.  **Testing the Network**: Evaluates the trained network's performance on the input data.
